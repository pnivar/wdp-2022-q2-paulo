        <section class="aboutme">
            <p>I am currently a Front-End Engineer apprentice, who always had a passion for IT. One of my favorite hobbies is using hardware to put together my own PCs. Having an attraction for computer hardware made me decide to explore the industry of programming languages. I am currently undergoing case studies starting from the basics which in terms will lead me towards becoming a Full-Stack Software Engineer. Feel free to explore the projects page of my portfolio to get a perspective of my capabilities in the application of my skills.</p>
